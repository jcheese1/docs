Ride is an NFT platform that allows meme creators to distribute their work to a huge number of collectors. 

The idea behind Ride is simple: **some things are more fun when more people own them.**

The platform has a unique rewards system. Each NFT launched on the site has 10% sent to a vault. **The best performing NFTs are airdropped to power users of Ride.** The protocol also takes a 0.5% swap fee. Users will be able to lock the SMOL memecoin to receive veSMOL, which allows holders to vote on which pools to receive fees from.
