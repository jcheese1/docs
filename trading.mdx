Anyone can create an NFT on Ride. NFTs launch in presale mode in the Recent Section. The price of the NFT remains the same during presale. If you no longer believe in the meme, you are free to sell back for your initial buy-in.

The presale ends after **$42k has been raised**. A liquidity pool is created with presale proceeds, and the NFT graduates to the Featured section. Users earn rewards for buying Featured NFTs and creating popular content on the platform.
