The protocol takes a 0.5% swap fees customary with other AMMs. Users will be able to lock the SMOL memecoin to receive **veSMOL**. veSMOL holders can vote on Featured NFTs to direct fee distribution. Each pool selected receives a portion of the 0.5% fees based on voting weight. veSMOL decays linearly over time, incentivizing users to maintain their locks for continued voting power.

Ride was built by Smolverse NFT contributors as an offshoot of the Magicswap DEX and released as a public good for Base. Ride does not have a token. Instead, the protocol is designed to drive value to the Smolverse community and Smol DAO treasury.
