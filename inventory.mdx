The inventory section of Ride shows the portfolio value of your current NFTs. Your inventory page also shows your profile on the platform. You can follow other peoplesâ€™ profiles to see what they create and trade.

After you make your first trade on Ride, you will unlock a **Pepe Smol** that becomes your avatar on the platform. The Pepe Smols collection has five trait categories with 200 trait variations in each for a total of 320 billion possible Smols.

Users will be able to mint new Pepe Smols in the future by **burning packs**. 

Pepe Smol holders will receive reward boosts for future airdrops. You will also receive a **perpetual rewards boost for holding Smol Brains NFTs**, the CC0 collection on which Pepe Smols are based.
